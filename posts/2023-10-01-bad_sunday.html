        I slept till 11 am. Not a good sign. But I was too anxious so I barely fell asleep earlier last night. I had a quick lunch with family, but I felt bad not being able to focus on topics they were interested in. I kept thinking about my homework, my exams, my research...

        My task today: (1) Read NLA book (didn't happen) (2) Finish NLA homework (only got 80% done).

        Even worse, when I was backing up in the parking lot of my apartment, I tapped a nearby car again. This drove me crazy... My car insurance will be crazily high next year. This was the second time I tapped a car. Now it makes perfect sense why they charge people under 25 high in car insurance, BECAUSE THINGS ALWAYS HAPPEN. Maybe life will fix itself after I get to my 25.
